# Syntax:
# This file is read in order; later entries that match a package win.

# Each "policy" stanza can contain a number of settings and a set of
# matches that determine what packages the policy applies to.
# All conditions in a match must be met. A match can check for:
#
# * uploader: E-mail appears in Uploaders field.
# * maintainer: E-mail matches Maintainer field email.
# * source_package: Name matches Source package name
# * in_base: Does the package appear in the base distribution
# * before_stage: whether a release stage has not yet been entered

# Support modes:
#  build_only: Build the package, but don't do anything with it
#  push: Push the changes to the packaging branch
#  propose: Create a merge proposal with the changes
#  bts: Create and maintain a patch in the BTS
#  attempt_push: Push the changes to the packaging branch;
#     if the janitor doesn't have permission to push, create a merge proposal
#     instead.

# URL to load freeze information from.
