# Syntax:
# This file is read in order; later entries that match a package win.

# Each "policy" stanza can contain a number of settings and a set of
# matches that determine what packages the policy applies to.
# All conditions in a match must be met. A match can check for
# appearance of an e-mail address in either the
# "Uploader" (uploader) or "Maintainer" (maintainer) or "Source"
# (source_package) fields of a source package.

# Support modes:
#  build_only: Build the package, but don't do anything with it
#  push: Push the changes to the packaging branch
#  propose: Create a merge proposal with the changes
#  bts: Create and maintain a patch in the BTS
#  attempt_push: Push the changes to the packaging branch;
#     if the janitor doesn't have permission to push, create a merge proposal
#     instead.

# Default behaviour
policy {
  # Note that there's no match stanza here so policy here applies to all
  # packages.
