# Syntax:
# This file is read in order; later entries that match a package win.

# Each "policy" stanza can contain a number of settings and a set of
# matches that determine what packages the policy applies to.
# All conditions in a match must be met. A match can check for
# appearance of an e-mail address in either the
# "Uploader" or "Maintainer" fields of a source package.

# Default behaviour
policy {
  # Possible values: skip, build_only, push, propose, attempt_push

  # For the moment, don't create merge requests by default.

  # Don't propose merges for upstream merges for now, since the janitor only
  # proposes changes to the main branch, not to pristine-tar/upstream.
