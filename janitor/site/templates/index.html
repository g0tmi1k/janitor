<h1>The Debian Janitor</h1>
<p>The Debian janitor is a project to automatically make changes to Debian
packages.</p>

<p>It finds VCS repositories associated with packages in the Debian archive, runs a
set of predefined operations on them, builds the resulting package and then
publishes the result (both as a VCS repository and as a Debian package).
</p>

<p>The overall goal is to reduce the manual effort that is needed
to maintain a Debian package, allowing maintainers to just click <em>Merge</em>
in a web UI and allowing users to try out newer upstream versions of packages
without the involvement of the maintainer.</p>
