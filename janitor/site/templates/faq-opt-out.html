<p>If you ignore or close the first merge proposal, there won't be any more for
the same maintainer.</p>

<p>You can also just comment on the merge proposal that you don't want any
automated merge proposals.</p>

<p>It would be great if you can also give us an idea of what
specifically you don’t appreciate about these merge proposals, and if
there’s anything that can be done to improve them.</p>
<p>Alternatively, propose a change to the <a class="reference" href="https://salsa.debian.org/jelmer/debian-janitor/blob/master/policy.conf">policy</a> on Salsa.</p>
