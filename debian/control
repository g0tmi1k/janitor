Description: management platform for large-scale automated code improvements - core
 The Janitor is a platform for running code improvement tools on a large number
 of repositories.
 .
 It takes a collection of VCS repositories and will regularly try to run a set
 of specified code improvement tools on those repositories. Scheduling takes
 into account tool-specific hints, past success and chances of success.
 .
 The web UI allows review and analysis of changes made.
 .
 Depending on policy set, changes are either pushed directly back to the
 repository or included in a pull request (that is kept up to date).
 .
 This package containers the core Python libraries.
