The Debian Janitor
==================

The Debian janitor is a project to automatically propose fixes for common and trivial to fix problems in Debian packages.

It finds repositories associated with packages in the Debian archive, runs a set of standard modifications over them, builds the resulting package and then creates a pull request with the resulting changes.

The ultimate goal is to reduce the overhead for simple archive-wide changes to the point that maintainers just have to click *_Merge_* in a web UI.
