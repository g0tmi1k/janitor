* *codebase*: A collection of source code files that are managed together in a
version control system. Usually this will be the root of a specific branch in a
vcs repository. Sometimes, it will be a subdirectory in a VCS. It can also be
e.g. a tarball somewhere.

* *cotenants*: Other codebases that share the same branch as the current codebase.
