This directory contains a basic script to process e-mails from GitLab and use
them to trigger immediate refreshing of the status of merge proposals.

Dovecot
=======

To use this script with dovecot's sieve filtering, enable the extprograms sieve plugin.

To configure the plugin, set something like:

    plugin {
      sieve_plugins = sieve_extprograms
      sieve_extensions = +vnd.dovecot.execute +editheader
      sieve_execute_bin_dir = /usr/lib/dovecot/sieve-pipe
      sieve_global_dir = /var/lib/dovecot/sieve/global
    }

The filter script should be placed in $sieve_execute_bin_dir.

You can then include the sieve filter ("janitor.sieve") in this directory to
trigger runs.
